			----------------------------------------

This file type plugin provides some additional functions and commands which
help writing and vim plugins. Especially big ones. Here is the list of
available commands and maps with some explanation:

======
NEWS							*ftpdev-news*	
>
 version 6
<
 The core functionality of |ftpdev-:Function|, |ftpdev-:Command|,
 |ftpdev-:MapLhs| and |ftpdev-:MapRhs| was rewritten in Python. If your Vim
 has Python interface (:echo has("+python")) then these commands will be much
 faster.

 For |ftpdev-:MapLhs| and |ftpdev-:MapRhs| if your vim is compiled with Python
 interface then the pattern matches can use '^' to match the begining of the
 lhs or rhs of the map (the '<plug>' is not included in the lhs/rhs).

 |g:ftplugin_dir| and |g:ftplugin_installdir| should work out of the box.
 |g:ftplugin_installdir| will work if one file of the project is already
 installed in the 'runtimepath' (and it is distinguished on under
 'runtimepath').

 |ftpdev-:Install| will print where it puts files and will make missing
 directories. It will exit silently if both  |g:ftplugin_dir| and
 |g:ftplugin_installdir| are set to the same value. This is useful when you
 set |ftpdev-:Install| through an autocommand and then edit files under the
 'runtimepath'.

 You can folow development of this plugin on GitHub:
 https://github.com/coot/vim_ftpdev

 NEW FEATURE: ~

 gd  - jump to local declaration: it finds the first declaration of the
 variable under the cursor. The declaration is search in the current function
 scope and outside all nested function definitions. Thus when you are outside
 a function whole script is searched backward from the cursor position,
 omitting all functions.

>
 version 5.4
<
 gn and gN changed into ]# and [# what is more in a vim way. See |ftpdev-]#|
 and |ftpdev-[#|.

 :Edit, :Split, ... commands removed. Instead the |path| option is set so you
 can use |:find|, |:sfind|, ... commands.

======
CONFIGURATION						*ftpdev-configure* 

							*ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir*
There is one variable which needs to be configured >
 g:ftplugin_dir
< This is the directory which will be searched for files. If you set this to
your ~/.vim/ftplugin directory where you have lots of scripts this plugin
might be a bit slow. Each plugin that I develop has its own directory (you
probably use some version control system as I do) then this variable is set
in my vimrc file via an autocommand: >
	au BufEnter /plugin_dev_dir/*		let g:ftplugin=<plugin_dev_dir>
<
							*ftpdev-:PluginDir*
:PluginDir {dir}	
	This sets value of the variable |ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir| to {dir}. It
	has dir type completion.

 							*ftpdev-g:ftplugin_ResetPath*
 |g:ftplugin_ResetPath| is set to 1 it will set |path|=g:ftplugin_dir, if not
 set or equal 0 it will add g:ftplugin_dir to |path| (only if the path already
 does not contain it). 
 This makes the use of |edit|, |split|, |vsplit|, |diffsplit| a lot nicer.

							*ftpdev-g:ftplugin_notinstall*
g:ftplugin_notinstall=['Makefile', '.*\.tar\.\%(bz2\|gz\)$', '.*\.vba$']
	This is list of patterns or file names relative to |g:ftplugin_dir|
	which will not be installed by the |ftpdev-:Install| command.

							*ftpdev-g:ftplugin_installdir*
g:ftplugin_installdir=split(&runtimepath,",")[0]
	Directory name where to |ftpdev-:Install| files.


TIP ~

 It might be good idea to put in your vimrc file: >
     au BufEnter  {path_to_project_dir}/* source ~/.vim/ftplugin/vim_ftdev.vim
<In this way you will get access to |ftpdev-:Function|, |ftpdev-:Command|, ...
 commands even in files of other file type than "vim" (for example in "txt"
 files).

======
COMMANDS AND MAPS					*ftpdev*

SEARCHING COMMANDS ~
:Function[!] {fname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Function*
	This finds function with name matching {fname} vim pattern under the
	|ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir| directory. It uses the internal grep, i.e.
	|lvimgrep|. {fname} should be as the first argument of |lvimgrep| except
	it doesn't have to be put between /.../.

	{fname} should not begin with <SID> or 's:' even if the function name
	has it.

	The bang is present |lvimgrep| is supplied with the j switch, i.e.
	the location list will be filled with matches without jumping to the
	first match.

	There is a completion for {fname}s.

	If [line] is non zero, go [lines] below. This is especially useful
	when you are debugging a script and you got en error in function
	{fname} at line [line].

:ListFunctions						 *ftpdev-:ListFunctions*
	List functions in defined in the current buffer.

:Command[!] {cname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Command*
	This finds command which name matches {fname} vim pattern under the
	|ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir| {cname} has the same syntax as {fname}. The
	bang works as in |ftpdev-:Function|

	There is a completion for {cname}s.
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

:ListCommands						*ftpdev-:ListCommands*
	List commands in defined in the current buffer.

:Variable[!] {vname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Variable*
	This finds variable definition matching {vname}. {vname} has to contain
	the g: b: s: t: prefix if the variable has it. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

:MapLhs[!] {maplhs} [line]				*ftpdev-:MapLhs*
	This finds maps which lhs matches {maplhs} vim pattern. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

	If Vim has Python interface then you can use '^' in {maplhs} pattern
	to match the start of the map name ('<plug> is not included into the
	map name). If Vim has not Python interface the {maplhs} always matches
	at the begining, thus if you want to match anywhere use '.*' at the
	begining of {maplhs}

:MapRhs[!] {maprhs} [line]				*ftpdev-:MapRhs*
	This finds maps which rhs matches {maprhs} vim pattern. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

	{maprhs} works in the same way as {maplhs} argument of |atp-:MapLhs|
	command (read there about the difference when Vim has Python
	interface).

	Note: [todo] some completions might not work (especially complex right
	hand side maps, Goto function should check for == in this case).

							*ftpdev-]#*
							*ftpdev-[#*
							*ftpdev-:S*
:S /{pattern}/
map ]#
map [#
	This function make a search of {pattern} in the current function (it
	can wrap around the end of function. The argument {pattern} is a vim
	pattern passed to |vimgrep|. Mixing |\v| and |\m| in a pattern is not
	supported.

	The pattern is added to search history and copied to the @/ register,
	thus you can re use it with |n| and |N| commands to search globally or
	gn and gN to search in the scope of current function.

	Note that you can first search with the vim standard |/| or |?| and
	then use |ftpdev-gn| and |ftpdev-gN|.

 							*ftpdev-:Eval*
:Eval
	Probably in your plugin there are debug |global-variables|. Then
	position the cursor on the begining of this variable :Eval will show
	you its value (if its defined). You can also use visual mode to select
	an expression, but the limitation is that every variable must be
	defined (thus it must be a global variable).

							*ftpdev-:Pgrep*
:Pgrep /{pattern}/[j][g]
	This makes |lvimgrep| in all files under |ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir|.  The
	argument syntax is the same as for |lvimgrep|.

This note is just for completeness:
Vim has its own vim.vim ftplugin which defines: 
	]] 	(next beginning of a function), 
	][ 	(next end of a function), 
	[[ 	(previous beginning of a function), 
	[] 	(previous end of a function).
	
nmap Gn							*ftpdev-Gn*
nmap GN							*ftpdev-GN*
	Go to next/previous if/else/elseif/endif pair (this, unlike |n| and |N|
	vim maps, doesn't depend on v:searchforward). These maps are defined
	by: >
 nmap	Gn	:call searchpair('^[^"]*\<\zsif\>', '^[^"]*\<\zselse\%(if\)\=\>', '^[^"]*\<\zsendif\>')<CR>
 nmap	GN	:call searchpair('^[^"]*\<\zsif\>', '^[^"]*\<\zselse\%(if\)\=\>', '^[^"]*\<\zsendif\>', 'b')<CR>
<	
	You can also use the |matchit| plugin. Just configure |b:match_words|
	variable.

INSTALLING PLUGIN TO THE RUNTIME PATH ~

:Install[!] 						*ftpdev-:Install*
	Without bang "!": it will copy the current buffer to the location
	under |g:ftplugin_installdir| be default it is first path that appear
	in 'runtimepath' vim option.  With bang "!": it will install all the
	files found under |g:ftplugin_dir| except the files in the
	(file/pattern) list |g:ftplugin_notinstall|.

	You can use this command in an autocommand for certain files: >
		au BufWritePost <some_file>	:Install
<
	If a directory tree is missing |ftpdev-:Install| will make it on the
	fly.

	If |g:ftplugin_dir| and |g:ftplugin_installdir| are equal the command
	silently returns. This is useful when you set :Install through an
	autocommand and edit files under the 'runtimepath'.

Happy vimming :)
