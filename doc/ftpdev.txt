			----------------------------------------

This file type plugin provides some additional functions and commands which
help writing and vim plugins. Especialy big ones. Here is the list of
available commands and maps with some explanation:

NEWS							*ftpdev-news*	

>
 version 4.1
<
 I change the maps in and iN to Gn and GN (they were interfereing with i).
>
 version 4
<
 :Map command is now splitted into two commands: |ftpdev-:MapLhs| and
 |ftpdev-:MapRhs| to match for left/right hand side of a map. Both have
 completion for arguments.

 With command |ftpdev-:Function|, |ftpdev-:Command|, |ftpdev-:MapLhs|,
 |ftpdev-:MapRhs|  you can specify additional argument to which line of the
 function goto. If there are more than one result they are printed. This is
 particularly useful when debugging a script and you got an error in function
 at a given line.
>
 version 3
<
In the version 3 there are two new commands:
:ListFunctions
:ListCommands
	They list functions and commands defined in the current file. 

:Function {function-name}
	Has completion for names of functions found in the project.
:Commands {command-name}
	Has completion for names of commands found in the project.

	Both completions add \> at the end of the function/command name to
	make the match exact. This is done by completion function and not,
	silently, by the commands (this makes a difference).

nmap Gn
nmap GN
	Goto next/previous if/else/elseif/endif pair (this, unlike |n| and |N|
	vim maps, doesn't depend on v:searchforward). These maps are defined
	by: >
 nmap	Gn	:call searchpair('^[^"]*\<\zsif\>', '^[^"]*\<\zselse\%(if\)\=\>', '^[^"]*\<\zsendif\>')<CR>
 nmap	GN	:call searchpair('^[^"]*\<\zsif\>', '^[^"]*\<\zselse\%(if\)\=\>', '^[^"]*\<\zsendif\>', 'b')<CR>
<	
	
>
 version 2
<
In the version 2 of thus plugin you get:
    map gn
    man gN
	    maps to search in the current function for the last search pattern @/.
	    They work like |n| and |N|.

    The messages for this search are now visibe.

    GetLatestVimScript support added.

							|ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir|
There is one variable which needs to be configured >
 g:ftplugin_dir
< This is the directory which will be searched for files. If you set this to
your ~/.vim/ftplugin directory where you have lots of scripts this plugin
might be a bit slow. Each plugin that I develop has its own directory (you
probably use some version control system as I do) then this variable is set
in my vimrc file via an autocommand: >
	au BufEnter /some_directory/*.vim	let g:ftplugin=<value>
<

:Function[!] {fname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Function*
	This finds function with name matching {fname} vim pattern under the
	|ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir| directory. It uses the internal grep, i.e.
	|vimgrep|. {fname} should be as the first argument of |vimgrep| except
	it doesn't have to be put between /.../ .

	{fname} can not begin with <SID> or 's:' even if the function name has
	it.

	The bang vimgrep is supplied with the j switch, i.e. only quickfix
	list will be filled with matches.

	There is completion for {fname}s.

	If [line] is non zero, go [lines] below. This is especially useful
	when you are debugging a script and you got en error in function
	{fname} at line [line].

:Command[!] {cname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Command*
	This finds command which name matches {fname} vim pattern under the
	|ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir| {cname> has the same syntax as {fname}. The
	bang works as in |ftpdev-:Function|

	There is completion for {cname}s.
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

:Variable[!] {vname} [line]				*ftpdev-:Variable*
	This finds variable definition matching {vname}. {vname} has to contain
	the g: b: s: t: prefix if the variable has it. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

:MapLhs[!] {maplhs} [line]					*ftpdev-:MapLhs*
	This finds maps which lhs matches {maplhs} vim pattern. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.

:MapRhs[!] {maprhs} [line]					*ftpdev-:MapRhs*
	This finds maps which rhs matches {maprhs} vim pattern. The bang works as in
	|ftpdev-:Function|
	The [line] argument is the same as in |ftpdev-:Function|.
							*ftpdev-gn*
							*ftpdev-gN*
							*ftpdev-:S*
:S /{pattern}/
map gn
map gN
	This function make a search of {pattern} in the current function (it
	can wrap around the end of function. The argument {pattern} is a vim
	pattern passed to |vimgrep|.

	The pattern is added to search history and copied to the @/ register,
	thus you can re use it with |n| and |N| commands to search globaly or
	gn and gN to search in the scope of current function.

	Note that you can first search with the vim standard |/| or |?| and
	then use |ftpdev-gn| and |ftpdev-gN|.

							*ftpdev-:PluginDir*
:PluginDir {directory}	
	This sets the variable |ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir|. It has dir type
	completion.

							*ftpdev-:Pgrep*
:Pgrep /{pattern}/[j][g]
	This makes |vimgrep| in all files '*.vim' under |ftpdev-g:ftplugin_dir|.
	The argument syntax is the same as for |vimgrep|.
	

Remember: Vim has its own vim.vim ftplugin which defines: 
	]] 	(next beginning of a function), 
	][ 	(next end of a function), 
	[[ 	(previous beginning of a function), 
	[] 	(previous end of a function).
	

Happy viming :)
