			----------------------------------------

This file type plugin provides some additional functions and commands which
help writing and vim plugins. Especialy big ones. Here is the list of
available commands and maps with some explanation:

							|vimvim-g:ftplugin_dir|
There is one variable which needs to be configured >
 g:ftplugin_dir
< This is the directory which will be searched for files. If you set this to
your ~/.vim/ftplugin directory where you have lots of scripts this plugin
might be a bit slow. Each plugin that I develop has its own directory (you
probably use some version control system as I do) then this vairable is set
in my vimrc file via an autocommand: >
	au BufEnter /some_directory/*.vim	let g:ftplugin=<value>
<

:Function[!] {fname}					*vimvim-:Function*
	This finds function with name mathcing {fname} vim pattern under the
	|vimvim-g:ftplugin_dir| directory. It uses the internal grep, i.e.
	|vimgrep|. {fname} should be as the first argument of |vimgrep| except
	it doesn't have to be put between /.../ .

	{fname} can not begin with <SID> or 's:' even if the function name has
	it.

	The bang vimgrep is supplied with the j switch, i.e. only quickfix
	list will be filled with mathes.
:Command[!] {cname}					*vimvim-:Command*
	This finds command which name matches {fname} vim pattern under the
	|vimvim-g:ftplugin_dir| {cname> has the same syntax as {fname}. The
	bang works as in |vimvim-:Function|
:Variable[!] {vname}					*vimvim-:Variable*
	This finds variable definition mathing {vname}. {vname} has to contain
	the g: b: s: t: prefix if the variable has it. The bang works as in
	|vimvim-:Function|

:Map[!] {maplhs}					*vimvim-:Map*
	This finds maps which lhs matches {maplhs} vim pattern. The bang works as in
	|vimvim-:Function|

:S /{pattern}/
	This function make a search of {pattern} in the current function (it
	can wrap around the end of function. The argument {pattern} is a vim
	pattern passed to |vimgrep|.

:PluginDir {directory}	
	This sets the variable |vimvim-g:ftplugin_dir|. It has dir type
	completion.

:Pgrep /{pattern}/[j][g]
	This makes |vimgrep| in all files '*.vim' under |vimvim-g:ftplugin_dir|.
	The argument syntax is the same as for |vimgrep|.
	

Remember: Vim has its own vim.vim ftplugin which defines: 
	]] 	(next begining of a function), 
	][ 	(next end of a function), 
	[[ 	(previous begining of a function), 
	[] 	(previous end of a function).
	

Happy viming :)
